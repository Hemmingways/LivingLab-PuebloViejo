  abstract  = {Access to modern energy services is an enabler of opportunity and a pillar that supports job creation, economic growth, and improved social well-being.  While the Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) identify universal access to safe, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy as one of the seventeen goals to promote sustainable global development, it is clear that uni- versal energy access also affects the achievement of many of the other SDGs, including the eradication of poverty, education, health, economic growth, reduced inequalities, and climate action (Barron and Torero, 2017; Lee et al., 2016; SEforALL and Power for All, 2017). Nearly 1.1  billion  people  globally  still  lack  access  to  basic  electricity  and  projections  indicate  that 674 million people will remain unelectrified in 2030, suggesting that a “business-as-usual” approach to electrification will not be sufficient to reach the SDG target (IEA, 2017). Beyond basic access, far more people lack the higher levels of electricity access needed to support income generation through small businesses, agriculture, industry, health services, and other productive uses. Global patterns in electricity access show uneven progress towards universal electrification. Nearly 90 percent of households lacking basic electricity access are rural (IEA, 2017). Althou- gh reaching rural households through grid connections continues to present challenges to expanding access, alternative electricity solutions including solar home systems and micro- grids  are  allowing  for  more  rapid  expansion  of  access  in  rural  and  peri-urban  areas.  These off-grid platforms have been successful in concentrated areas, suggesting the potential to scale quickly in new markets.},

  abstract  = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to improve the effectiveness of university–industry collaboration (UIC). This work enhances the existing body of literature and knowledge regarding collaboration and offers concrete steps to be taken for effective collaboration between universities and industries. Research Methodology A literature review to study the best practices, impediments to collaboration and the various models proposed in the past for successful UIC was conducted. A workshop and focus-group meetings of practitioners and academic researchers was designed and organised to explore the current state of the university–industry engagement within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region and gather inputs regarding possible approaches to improve collaboration. The findings from the literature review and the results from this qualitative research regarding the approaches to improve the effectiveness of the collaboration were analysed. Results and implications The study discovers that various measures have been proposed in the form of best practices or models to improve the effectiveness of UIC. However, these measures often address a specific concern such as technology transfer, intellectual property (IP), etc. There is a scope for a comprehensive holistic framework to address many aspects of UIC in order to improve effectiveness and achieve success. A framework for improving the effectiveness of collaboration considering a comprehensive list of factors operating in a broad context within the collaboration system was proposed. Originality/value The framework builds on previous literature dealing with measures for successful UIC. However, it is the first of its kind, in the researcher's knowledge, in terms of comprehensiveness of the factors contributing to establishing and sustaining successful collaboration. The value of the individual experience of the participants in this qualitative research, which is on average more than 10 years in the software engineering field, validates the importance and quality of the data collected. The addition of these results to the framework increases its validity.The framework can be utilised by universities and industry practitioners to foster successful and effective collaboration. The results have significant relevance, particularly within the Australian context as the government has intensified the adoption of measures to encourage and improve collaboration between universities and the industry.},

  abstract  = {A key global challenge is the provision of access to modern energy services to all. Indicators such as national electrification rates can mask significant inadequacies in supply, while delivering electricity for last-mile communities involves particular challenges. This paper presents a timely and important contribution by employing a novel mixed methods approach to understand the process and impacts of electrification in Chocó, a ‘forgotten space’ within Colombia. Chocó is a densely forested, post-conflict region that is characterised by low socio-economic indicators. The paper examines the extent to which the benefits of electricity access have been realised for five villages in the municipality of Bahia Solano. A longitudinal study including surveys, interviews and a classification of households with the World Bank's Multi-Tier Framework provides insights into household energy use, expenditure and outcomes of the electrification process. Using these findings to define future demand scenarios, an energy system optimisation model was used to design a renewable micro-grid for the study villages revealing that distributed renewable energy systems can provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to grid extension. The research shows that the benefits of electrification cannot be assumed, particularly where programmes have a narrow focus on energy infrastructure alone. The delivery of electricity access is not a one-step intervention. It must involve ongoing engagement and consider the social, environmental, economic and political contexts in which people live. Only through this more grounded approach will the benefits of energy for sustainable development be realised.},
