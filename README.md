## Co-developing solutions to improve access to electricity for a community in Colombia

Project duration: **04/2021-09/2021**

With the goal to improve the quality of life of a community in north Colombia, Pueblo Viejo, a binational cooperation project was launched. 

It aims toward the provision of reliable and affordable access to electric power through demand-driven and sustainable solutions. The project is led by the state-supported university **Universidad del Magdalena located in Santa Marta**, the capital of Magdalena Province in northern Colombia. Interdisciplinary working groups have convened living laboratories for sustainability, cooperation, and innovation. In 2019, the Universidad del Magdalena collaborated with the Institute of Energy Technology (IET) at **TU Berlin** in 2019 for the **project "Rejuveneciendo Pueblo Viejo"**.

A population survey identified access to electricity and poverty reduction as the main needs. This collaboration is also supported by the startup HEDERA Sustainable Solutions with various digital tools for impact analysis using the Multi-Tier Framework approach for energy access measurement. The IASS Potsdam (Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies e.V.) likewise contributes content expertise on energy access and energy justice as well as to living laboratories and designing research methodologies along the projects.

## Objectives

The aim of this follow-up project is now to **stablish a diagnostic on access to electricity** and to find **solidarity-based solutions** together with the local population that will enable a way out of energy poverty. Progress will then be measured using appropriate methods. Households, businesses, and public institutions will be surveyed about access to electricity. Communication materials will be written in different languages and online seminars or conferences will be held to raise awareness and propose solutions. To achieve both local and global scopes, further research to be addressed in the future will also be formulated for further project collaborations. Long-term academic research and practical cooperation between Colombia and Germany is foreseen.

## Description of the ASA program
The project takes place within the framework of the ASA program. The ASA program is an offer of Engagement Global and provides developmental learning, qualification, and engagement spaces. Students and people with completed vocational training between the ages of 21 and 30 who want to understand global interrelationships, ask critical questions and campaign for a just world can apply for around 240 scholarships each year. These allow participation in several seminars and the chance to work on an international project. Participation in the program is intended to enable them to play a long-term and effective role in shaping the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in politics, business and society and thus contribute to the fulfillment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a globalized world. The program is implemented on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).
